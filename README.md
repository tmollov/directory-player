# Directory player

Idea of this project is to create cross-platform music player which is *like* **1by1**, but with less options which will make it more user-friendly.  
The only features I will implement is:

- Music playback: play / pause / prev-next / repeat this-all
- Adding Favorite folder
- Volume control

## What Directory Player UI will contain?

### Section: Folder select / file select

This section will contain views for folders which will come with predefined folders and files that are in selected folder.  
You will able to add other folders manually in your *favorite folders* lists.

### Section: Selected file
