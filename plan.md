# About project

Idea of this project is to create cross-platform music player which is *like* **1by1**, but with less options which will make it more user-friendly.
The only feature i will implement is:

- Music playback: play / pause / prev-next / repeat this-all
- Adding Favorite folder
- Volume control

## What Directory Player UI will contain?

### Section for Folder select / file select section

This section will contain view for folders which will come with predefined folders and files that are in selected folder.
You will able to add other folders manually in your *favorite folders* lists.
Every time you select a folder files will be shown.

- Section for: File name / short meta data / time [elapsed:duration] and the picture from mp3 / or default picture for audio
- Section for: Elapsed time:duration time
